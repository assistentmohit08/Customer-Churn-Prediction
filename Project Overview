Customer churn is one of the most critical business metrics for telecom industries. 
Churn refers to customers who leave the service. Predicting churn helps companies take proactive actions such as offering discounts, improving services, and identifying risky customers.

This project builds a Machine Learning model to predict whether a customer will churn based on demographic information, account details, and service usage patterns.
